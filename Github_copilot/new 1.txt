Yes its possible. We have tried upgrading lower framework code to a newer framework for other languages

in that case, can we do it for the entire project file OR convert it component/module wise ?...

the only bummer is that GH-Copilot and ChatGPT3.5 are trained with data until a few years ago.. so it can not help on recent modern tools..   example: in frontend, if you ask it to write unit test using vitest, it gives you code with jest.. vite & jest are different test libraries (Kinda like you aâ€¦

Not sure about this. I tried it myself and it didnt use jest

The model used by copilot is trained separately and doesn't depend entirely on the GPT 4 training

are you sure that's a working code? is there really 'suite' from vitest?

Not as of today. For the time being to utilize copilot feature you can use VSCode for Mac
